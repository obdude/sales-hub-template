                <p>You sit down at your desk, coffee in hand, ready to tackle your most important project. The blank page is staring back at you. You know *exactly* what you need to do.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>But first, a "quick check" of your email. Then Twitter. Then Instagram. Suddenly, an hour has vanished and you've accomplished nothing.</li>
                    <li>You spend more time organizing your to-do list in a fancy app than actually *doing* the tasks on the list. It feels productive, but it's just a clever form of procrastination.</li>
                    <li>By 4 PM, a wave of guilt washes over you. Another day "wasted." You promise yourself that tomorrow will be different... but it rarely is.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>It's Not Your Fault... You've Been Set Up to Fail.</h3>
                <p>You've been fed a lie by "productivity gurus" that the answer is to wake up at 5 AM, take ice-cold showers, and build a color-coded "second brain" in a complex app. They tell you that you just need more discipline.</p>
                <p>The truth is, your brain is wired to resist uncertainty and seek out easy, predictable rewards (like social media notifications). Fighting this with sheer willpower is a battle you will lose every time.</p>

                <p>This isn't another 300-page book on productivity theory. It's a short, actionable blueprint designed to give you one thing: a reliable way to *start*. It's a simple "ignition sequence" for your brain that bypasses resistance and makes entering a state of flow almost automatic.</p>
                <p>Unlike methods that require massive life changes, The 5-Minute Focus leverages a proven psychological trigger to build immediate momentum, turning the most daunting tasks into something you can start in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee.</p>

                <p>Hi, I'm Alex Carter. I'm not a productivity guru who was born organized. For years, I was a freelance writer drowning in deadlines I couldn't start, paralyzed by the "blank page" anxiety. I tried every app, system, and hack out there.</p>
                <p>It wasn't until I stopped trying to be "more disciplined" and focused on one tiny thing—making the first 5 minutes ridiculously easy—that everything changed. I developed a simple system that short-circuited my procrastination. Since then, I've used it to write 3 books and help over 2,500 other creatives finally get their best work out into the world.</p>

                    <p class="faq-question">I have ADHD. Will this work for me?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">While this isn't a medical treatment, many readers with ADHD have found the method extremely helpful because it's not based on <em>trying harder.</em> It's about lowering the barrier to entry so much that starting becomes easy, which works well for executive function challenges.</p>

                    <p class="faq-question">How quickly will I get access?</p>

                    <p class="faq-question">Isn't this just the Pomodoro Technique?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">No. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method for <em>during</em> work. The 5-Minute Focus is a system for <em>starting</em> work, which is often the hardest part. They can be used together, but they solve two different problems.</p>

                    <p class="faq-question">What if I'm just too lazy for this to work?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">This system is designed for people who <em>feel</em> lazy. You'll discover that what you call 'laziness' is often just a symptom of friction and overwhelm. By reducing that friction to almost zero, you don't need motivation to get started.</p>
